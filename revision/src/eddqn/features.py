"""Causal (prospective) feature engineering.

Every feature of sample t in session s is a function of samples 0..t of the
same session only (trailing windows, cumulative sums).  Data-driven constants
(the acceleration-spike threshold and the imputation value) are learned in
:meth:`CausalFeaturizer.fit` from TRAINING rows only and frozen afterwards.

Removed relative to the raw export (see reports/02_preprocessing_audit.md):

* ``DiscomfortLevel`` and anything derived from it (label).
* ``CameraFieldOfView``: constant within each game in the curated release
  (Race 96.016, Flight 111.755) -> a duplicate of the game indicator.
* ``StaticFrame``, ``CameraAutoMovement``: constant within each game
  (Race: True/False, Flight: False/True) -> duplicates of the game indicator.
* ``HapticFeedback``, ``DegreeOfControl``, ``DofSimulation``, ``Locomotion``,
  ``UserPosture``: constant over the whole curated release.
* ``PlayerPositionX/Y/Z``: absolute course coordinates; Z grows almost
  linearly with time in the Flight game, the columns are absent from the
  Oct-2019 wave, and they would let a model memorise course locations.
Participant questionnaire fields (gender, age band, VR experience, glasses,
vision problems, eye dominance, flicker) are filled in BEFORE the session
(Cybersickness Profile Questionnaire), so they are prospective.  They are
constant per participant and could act as quasi-identifiers under a
row-level split; under the linkage-group split used here a test group's
exact profile never occurs in its training data (groups are built from
identical profiles), so they can only contribute through shared attribute
values (e.g. "no prior VR experience").  Whether to use them is a tuned
feature-set choice made on inner validation folds only; ``UserSymptoms`` and
``UserPosture`` are constant in the curated release and are dropped.
